# Grippy Robot Wheels

These 2.75in (70mm) robot wheels have tons of traction and were originally designed to address the critical issue of slippage in autonomous robotics competitions. Traditional wheels from robot kits often fail to provide adequate grip, resulting in unreliable localization and compromised robot performance. These wheels offer superior traction on multiple surfaces, including plywood, concrete, melamine, MDF, foam, tile... This enhanced grip ensures that the robots can navigate accurately and efficiently, regardless of the operating environment.

These wheels are designed to work with shaft sizes ranging from 2mm to 8mm, making them versatile for various robotic applications. The assembly process is straightforward, requiring no DIY moulding or janky wheel/shaft adapters.

The provided CAD files allows easy modification of the design to accommodate other motor coupler solutions. The design prioritizes ease of assembly and reliability. To maintain full traction, these wheels should be cleaned with tape or a wet cloth if there is any particle buildup.

There are 4in and 3.25in Vex Wheels that are made of the same material. A similar approach could be used for those wheels.
